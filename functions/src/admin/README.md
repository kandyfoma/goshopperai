2. **Configure Firebase:**

   - Ensure Firebase Admin SDK has proper permissions

3. **Run the tools:**

   - Web: `npm run admin:web`

## Security Notes

- These tools have full database access
- Use only in development/testing environments
- Never deploy to production
- Consider adding authentication for the web admin in production

## Firebase Console Alternative

For basic operations, you can also use the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com):

- Authentication → Users
- Firestore Database → Collections
- Functions → Logs
- Storage → Files

The admin tools provide more advanced operations and bulk actions not available in the console.
